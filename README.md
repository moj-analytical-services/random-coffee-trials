# random-coffee-trials
This is a code used to create random coffee trial pairings, taking into account pairs that have been generated previously.
This code will create a .csv output of pair- person 1 data - person 2 data.

We are hoping to do the following:

1) Create an online form that users can fill in themselves to update the total names in the pool
2) Create online form to allow users to update their details (Departments, scheme years and emails) as they move
3) Find a mail merge to send out automatic emails to each pair to save them sifting time through the .csv
